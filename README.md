# Wine Training App
## Develop Parallel Machine Learning (ML) applications in Amazon AWS cloud platform.

### You have to build a wine quality prediction ML model in Spark over AWS. The model must be trained in parallel using 4 EC2 instances. Then, you need to save and load the model in a Spark application that will perform wine quality prediction; this application will run on one EC2 instance. The assignment must be implemented in Java on Ubuntu Linux.
